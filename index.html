                <p>
                        When I was around 12 years old, our family dog Rusty, a beautiful Irish Setter from Champion Bloodline passed away. I wanted us to get another dog, but my parents did not want the responsibilities and commitment of having a dog anymore.  Since I was needing to earn some money, our family came to a good compromise.  The solution was to have me start Pet Sitting with Pet Sitters Inc. Owners would bring their dogs to our home, and we would take care of them like our own pet. 
                </p>
                <p> This service was ideal because many dogs would become too stressed out in an ordinary kennel service, and this would become like a second home to these dogs.  I have watched over 100 different dogs over 7 years and below are some memorable dogs we watched. </p>

               <h2>Bart the Bulldog</h2>
               <p>
                    One of the first dogs we watched was a Bulldog named Bart.  He was extremely funny, mainly because he was always snorting and slobbering.  He was always happy, and wagging his tail while snorting.  He also loved to take long naps with his tongue always sticking out.

               <h2>Taj the Rottweiler</h2></a>
               <p>
                    Taj was not the kind of Rottweiler you may hear about in TV news reports.  He was very friendly and extremely obedient.  His owners worked with him a lot so he always did what he was told.  You could just gently say the word "kennel" and he would run to his sleeping crate and wait for us to close the door.

               <h2>Brian and Sandy the Shar Pei's</h2>
               <p>
                   Brian and Sandy were the names of two goofy Shar Pei's. (wrinkle dogs!)  They were super alert and observant to everything that was going on.  They both had very strong watchdog instincts, and would jump into action if they thought something was amiss.  The owners of these dogs were out of town a lot on business, and we probably watched these two dogs more than any other.

                <h2>Ben the Labrador</h2>
                <p>
                     Ben was a super happy (and fat!) Labrador Retriver.  While we watched many Labs over the years, Ben was memerable because he was always so happy and freindly.  Just walking into the room while he was napping would set his tail thumping onto the floor.  He would always want to go where you went, but never got upset if you had to leave him alone.  He was so happy and easy going!

                <h2>Rex the Bullmastiff</h2>
                <p>
                    Not all the dogs we watched were good or friendly dogs.  Rex, a huge 100+ pound Bullmastiff, has become imfamous in our family for biting my Dad in the face!  My Dad was on the floor with the dog petting him lovingly (as he always does) and the dog unexpectedly and without warning chomped onto my dad's cheek.  Thankfully the dog didn't thrash, and let go a few seconds later.  My dad healed up pefectly, and you never would know today.  Needless to say we did not watch ole' Rex again!

               <h2>Cooper the Cocker Spaniel</h2>
               <p>
                   Another trouble-dog in our Pet Sitting history was a young Cocker Spaniel named Cooper.  This dog would nip and bite and everyone and everything!   Non-stop biting and nipping for days!  He would try to destroy anything he thought he could, and if you tried to stop him he would try to bite you!  Not a fun dog to be around, and we also did not choose to watch this dog again!

                <h2>Jake the Golden Retriever</h2></a>
                <p>
                    Of all the dogs we watched, our very favorite of all was Jake the Golden Retriever.  Jake was was asoundingly smart and able to understand many commands and body launguge.  He was also very friendly, and if we all left the house, he would go around and find any loose socks or clothing and pile them up at the front door for us when we returned home.  He was so proud of this clothin pile.. it was almost as if he was greeting us with gifts!  When letting him outside, he would slowly prowl, like a lion, out the door.  Creeping along very slowly.. looking for any wildlife in the backyard.  If he spotted anything, he would continue to creep, but slowly start speeding up, until he was in full chase of the squirrel/rabbit/bird.   He loved to swim and you could tell he was looking for fish when in the swimming pool.  He was an all around great dog and is missed very much.

                <p>I created many great memories through my years pet sitting, and was able learn about many different dog breeds.  Who knows, maybe someday when I'm old I'll go back to my first ever job of Pet Sitting and call it my retirement job!
